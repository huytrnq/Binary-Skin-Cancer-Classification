# Introduction
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a binary classification model to classify skin cancer images into two classes: Benign and Malignant.

# Dataset
The dataset is a subset of the [HAM10000 dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) which contains 10015 dermatoscopic images of skin lesions from 7 different classes. The dataset is divided into two parts: the training set and the test set. The training set contains 15200 images, and the validation set contains 3â€¯802 images.
